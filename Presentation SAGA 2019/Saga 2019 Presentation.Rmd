## Motivation:

- Regional disparity has been the main subject of many studies in Indonesia

- Only few studies have focused on disparity at district level and during decentralization process (Vidyattama 2013)

- Persistent income differences despite several policy efforts (Akita 1988; Garcia and Soelistianingsih 1998; Kataoka 2012)

## Research Objective:
  
- Study the spatio-temporal dynamics of income per capita accross districts in Indonesia over 2000-2017

## Methods:

- Spatial Autocorrelation Moran's I (Moran 1948, Anselin et. al 2006)

- Distributional convergence framework (Quah 1996; Hyndman et. al 1996)

- Getis Filter (Getis 1995)

## Data:

- 34 provinces and 514 districts over the 2000-2017 period.

## Main Results:

1. **Significant Spatial Autocorrelation** at the districts level 

2. **Persistent Distributional Convergence** at middle income level distribution

3. **Convergence Clubs** at upper and lower distribution

4. **Filtered and non-filtered dynamic data ** spatial dependece helps to reduce disparities

##Does the economic performance of neighbouring regions determine the regional convergence? 
"Strong sign of Spatial Autocorrelation Moran's I at Districts level"


$$I = \frac{\sum_i\sum_j w_{ij} z_i.z_j}{\sum_i z_i^2} = \frac{\sum_i (z_i \times \sum_j w_{ij} z_j)}{\sum_i z_i^2}.$$

# Getis Spatial Filter

Conducting Getis Spatial Filter to solve the problem of a violation of independence assumption that cause misguided inferences and interpretations (Rey and Janikas, 2005).


$$x_i^* = \frac{xi(W_i)}{(n-1)G_i(d_m)}$$

#Concluding Remarks

## Inequality still matters 

- Converge clubs at small group of pooreer and richer.
- Most regions (medium income level) are persistent.

## However,neighboring districs play an important role
- The economic performance of the districts in general was likely tend to be influenced positively by neighboring districts's performance.
- Significant role of neighbors effects in reducing inequality. 

## Implications 

- Call for better coordination of regional policies at the cluster level.
- Enhance interregional connectivity and cooperation.
- For further research : 
  - What is the role of geographical neighbors in accelerating  convergence?
  - Conducting similar approach for different development indicator, such as Human Development Index
